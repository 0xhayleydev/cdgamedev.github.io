                <h1>Information:</h1>
                <p>
                    Written in C# using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019.
                    <span class="gap medium"></span>
                    The Tinkering Audio project was the 2nd assignment for COMP120 on the Game Development: Programming course at Falmouth University.
                    <span class="gap medium"></span>
                    I worked alongside Daisy Baker in the project where we took part in the agile development process known as Pair Programming.
                    <span class="gap medium"></span>
                    This project, as its name suggests, was made to as an audio manipulation tool.
                    <span class="gap medium"></span>

            <h1>Potential Contracts:</h1>
            <p>For the project, we had to chose from 4 contracts. These were as follows;</p>
            <h3 class="contract-heading">Contract #1 - Sound Effect Generation (Diegetic Audio)</h3>
            <p class="contract-summary">
                You are currently been tasked with creating a tool which will generate sound effects, these should consist of sequences of tone as well as sample manipulations. 
                The sound effect should be clearly tied to an action the player makes in the game (e.g., picking up an item, attacking, walking over a trap, or so on).
                An element of procedurality is expected to vary the tones.
            </p>
            <h3 class="contract-heading">Contract #2 - Ambient Platformers Audio Generation (Diegetic Audio)</h3>
            <p class="contract-summary">
                It has been decided that you need to make a tool which will generate ambient audio tracks to make the player feel like they are in different areas of the game’s setting.
                Think something like SyrinScape!
                A variety of settings that should be configurable by a designer and allow them to vary ambience of each level, ideally each zone within a level.
            </p>
            <h3 class="contract-heading">Contract #3 - Melody Generation (Non-Diegetic Audio)</h3>
            <p class="contract-summary">
                You are tasked with creating a tool which procedurally generates and exports a music track for the game.
                It will be important to research some rules to see which tones and samples go well with each other to design the synthesiser.
                An ability to draw upon both tones and samples is expected!
                The style of music is up to you as the developer, but should fit the creativity card brief and the style of your particular game, but is anticipated to be somewhat simplistic and retro.
            </p>
            <h3 class="contract-heading">Contract #4 - User Interface Audio (Non-Diegetic Audio)</h3>
            <p class="contract-summary">
                You need to develop a tool to generate audio for the user interface.
                These should be short tones to feed back to the player that they are successfully navigating the user interface and configuring the game’s settings.
                This should be somewhat consistent across the interface, but the tones and samples should be modified in a systematic way to indicate success or failure.
                A variety of settings should be made available and configurable by a designer.
            </p>

            <h1>Project Details:</h1>
            <p>Overall, we chose to work with <b>"Contract #2 - Ambient Platformers Audio Generation (Diegetic Audio)"</b>.</p>
            <p>This was because we felt it was the most thought provoking and something we thought we could do well.</p>
